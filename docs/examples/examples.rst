Examples
=================
Here are a handful of examples and scripts demonstrating how the grandlig module can be used for ligand based GCNCMC sampling in OpenMM. More examples will be added over time.

These scripts are also found at: https://github.com/essex-lab/grand-lig/tree/master/examples

Other scripts can be found at: https://github.com/essex-lab/grandlig-paper (Note: these are deisgned to reproduce results of a paper but are useful for inspiration.)

Manifest:
 - Basic_Simulation - Scripts to run a minimal GCNCMC simulation using arg parse for arguments
 - lysozyme_bindingsite - Scripts to find the occluded binding site of T4L99A using Benzene probes.
 - HelperScripts - Some scripts which may be helpful  
 - Mu_Ex_Calculation - Example of how to calculate the excess chemical potential of 0.5 M Benzene
