# _grand_ : Grand Canonical Water Sampling in OpenMM

### Background

This Python module is designed to be run with OpenMM in order to simulate grand
canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) insertion and deletion moves of water molecules.
This allows the particle number to vary according to a fixed chemical
potential, and offers enhanced sampling of water molecules in occluded
binding sites.
The theory behind our work on GCMC sampling can be found in the References
section below.

### Installation & Usage

This module can be installed from this directory by running the following
command:

```commandline
python setup.py install
```

The unit tests can then be carried out by running the following command from
this directory:
```commandline
python setup.py test
```

The dependencies of this module can be installed as:

```commandline
conda install -c conda-forge -c omnia openmmtools
pip install lxml
```
Many of grand's dependencies (openmm, mdtraj, pymbar, parmed) are also dependencies of 
openmmtools, and will be installed alongside openmmtools.

Alternatively, _grand_ and its dependencies can be installed via conda:
```commandline
conda install -c omnia -c anaconda -c conda-forge -c essexlab grand
```

Several (very short) examples of how this module is ran alongside OpenMM can be found in
the `examples/` directory.
Additional [examples](https://github.com/essex-lab/grand-paper) and 
[documentation](https://grand.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) are also available.

The _grand_ module is released under the MIT licence. If results from this
