# _grand_ : Grand Canonical Molecular Dynamics in OpenMM

Version : 1.0.0

### Background

This Python module is designed to be run with OpenMM in order to simulate grand
canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) insertion and deletion moves of water molecules.
This allows the particle number to vary according to a fixed chemical
potential, and offers enhanced sampling of water molecules in occluded
binding sites.
The theory behind our work on GCMC sampling can be found in the References
section below.

### Installation & Usage

This module can be installed from this directory by running the following
command:

```commandline
python setup.py install
```

The dependencies of this module can be installed as:

```commandline
conda install -c omnia openmm mdtraj parmed openmmtools pymbar
pip install lxml
```

Several (very short) examples of how this module is ran alongside OpenMM can be found in
the `examples/` directory.
