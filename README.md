# gcmc-openmm

This private repo repo stores my attempts to run GCMC sampling of water molecules in the OpenMM simulation engine.
Currently have a basic framework to do this, but certain points need to be added/tweaked.

The idea is to make this as generally transferable as possible, so that it can be easily integrated with other work based in OpenMM.

### To Do
- Make sure all parameters are correct (need to calculate hydration free energies for each model)
- Write out which waters are ghosts

Also need to do some rigorous testing at some point to make sure that everything has been implemented correctly.
